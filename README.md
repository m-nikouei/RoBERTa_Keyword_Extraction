## Keyword Extraction Notebook

In this notebook, we do keyword extraction using transformers' embeddings on [inspec](https://github.com/LIAAD/KeywordExtractor-Datasets/blob/master/datasets/Inspec.zip) dataset. Here, we are not extracting top keywords of each individual document. Instead, we are getting top keywords of all documents in the dataset. Of course, a byproduct of these process is the top keywords of each individual documents. All keywords extracted with these model are present in the document set.
